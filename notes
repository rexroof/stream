- monday rebirth

update my tau client secret for twitch

today:

- does my stream work?
- key combo to zoom cam or eton
- can I scale a panel with tmux bindings?

todo: 
- fix cam scene so that eton isn't hidden when tmux not active
- have #so validate that there is a real streamer
- replace word with pwgen output based on size of replaced word
   [creativenull]: it should be trival with :h system() and add setline()

weekend:

[oskarallan]: impressive, I thought it was impossible to remember tar options
[creativenull]: it should be trival with :h system() and add setline()

tau:

- the .env should not be built into the container
- updated docker-compose to fix DB password issue
- running bash ni container printed all envs.
  - why the env | xargs stuff still?
