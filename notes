[oskarallan]: change-inside and change-around is how i remember it
[cafce25]: could read it as (f)ind character

--- 
[cafce25]: vertical seems fine
[cafce25]: horizontal is weird
[cafce25]: i think its / instead of * new_scaling_
[cafce25]: new_scaling = s_width / result[]
[cafce25]: and we * by result[] / s_width
[cafce25]: if we divide both sides by s_width in line 226
[cafce25]: we get "new_scaling = s_width / result[...]"
[cafce25]: yea height
[cafce25]: no i mean result[..]
[cafce25]: NotLikeThis
