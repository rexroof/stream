- wednesday

today:
- lspcontainers?

todo: 
- try tau again from scratch


[finitesingularity]: Its got more of a rich/corn flavor..

[oskarallan]: try :lua vim.lsp.buf. and then tab your way
[oskarallan]: and they are all functions, so you need to add () after them
[oskarallan]: they are saying that the on_attach func only runs after a LSP is attached, so if you have keymaps that only make sense in a LSP context they wont get loaded if there isnt a LSP

[creativenull]: not to install but to get the correct command to run in the docker container
[creativenull]: looks like it named it as the dir name it was cloned into
