- 1; needs more content?
- 12 ; do we need this slide?
[stupac62]: off the top of my head, I would want to know what the problem it's solving, why I need that, then how it does it
add configmaps
rework second half
ending slide!
[stupac62]: title: what is kubernetes.. rex: this won't explain what kubernetes is.. LUL
[dota2attitude]: you could mention stuff that "works with" kubernetes, vs stuff kubernetes replaces
[stupac62]: remove definition from slide
[stupac62]: 15 seconds isn't long enough.. I'm distracted with the words on text and then trying to listen to you.
[dota2attitude]: I think if you want 15s slides the slides have to be single sentences
[stupac62]: like you said here's the definition so I started reading but couldn't listen to you. I read like 2 sentences then it switched slides
