- wednesday

today:

todo:
- resources and limits and scheduling
regarding tmux pane location:
[stupac62]: "should" can you verify by doing your own calc tho?
[stupac62]: since we know 0 y value works perfectly, just count the total rows and verify against what tmux is giving you for the lower pane's y axis


hpa:
- CRD and controller
- definitions on pod
- requires metrics server
