- monday

today:
- ssl setup with lets encrypt
  - complicated by 3 servers
  - duplicate for other sites
  - set up manual auth hook.
- feed the chickens

todo: 
- chat-bonsai.sh not found

[dario_satu]: yeah but thankfully we found other ways to preserve availability without necessarily keeping each machine on forever
